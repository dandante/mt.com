## Impossible Aubade with News and a Crumb

<div style="white-space: pre;">

                                          by Molly Tenenbaum
										  
Last I remember, sunset clumb the pencil-vines,
    now it's down, allergies, down,
        dustpan. Line like a plucked eyebrow
at the dustpan's edge. What did our forebrooms do,
    in the nineteenth century? A tornado house
        thumped on a one-year-old boy, Mr. Radio says—
saved by a mattress. Mice out, cat in, I'm closing
    the cat-flap. Which way is a door? Pan-faced
        or deadpan, I'll meet you with a rolling pin,
meet you with my best Yiddish,
    I'll have you rolling, I'll meet you
        at the office, by the canal, where can I meet
to kiss you? Honey, say a word.
    Let me guess. Licorice? When does a joke
        sound like a joke? Fisticuffs?
Transient. Mourning lost children
    in a true book, Mom's sunk first thing
        in black thoughts. “What do you with them?”
I'd scribble, walk, yank weeds—
    “Someone calls and the day gets going,” her answer,
        here in the waiting room, where, in Family Circle,
we read they can see in the brain
    high spikes of stress smoothing down
        the instant a word applies.
I'd thought we all, electrode or no, knew this,
    but not, I guess, Mom. As for me,
        here's the mouse, the many of many
nibbling in weeds by the drainpipe,
    pounced on, pierced, trotted in
        dangling alive, who at the meow,
scrambled into the washer, and since it once cost me
    a hundred bucks to fix a chewed laundry hose,
        kitchen an inch deep in water
(at least the floor got mopped that year),
    it's my washer or your life. One peanut
        in a glue-trap, and at the squeal,
I lift trap and all, poor thing, trap and all,
    opal transparent front feet in glue,
        opal transparent back feet swinging,
into a bag, set it on the hard driveway,
    and in my wood clogs stomp hard fast as I can.
        Not fair, mouse, minding your own.
Cat swooped you, I killed you, not
    your fault, mine,
        but let's say it's the world's—
the world with its give and take lace
    like moth-holed borders of tablecloths
        mom won't again be using,
lace like this skeleton leaf
    tracked to the just-swept linoleum.
        Lace as in the frilled collars
they wore in the nineteenth century,
    “To hide their tubercular sores,”
        my doctor once said, seeing the portait
on the Brontë bio I closed as he walked in.
    Baby, when I meet you by the willow for lunch,
        I won't recall any of this.
I'll be remembering the moon
    on the moving water, the black
        stormy branches. I'll be glimmering
all my warm edges at you, we're so near,
    just one wall away
        from the scratchy couch
and its hard wood arms
    that kept us, that night, as something always
        keeps us, apart.
