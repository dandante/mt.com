<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Cover</strong><br />
The cover features one of my grandfather's early ventriloquist figures. I believe this one was named Alexander.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Breathe from the Diaphragm&quot;<br />
</strong>My grandfather tried to teach me the art of ventriloquism when I was a girl. Sadly, it did not take. I did not yet understand the concept of practice. And besides that, I couldn't get beyond step one, since I couldn't find my diaphragm.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Easy Oration&quot;</strong><br />
This poem contains none of the consonants that make the ventriloquist's lips meet, so it's an easy speech for the dummy to make. Try it without moving your lips.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&quot;Daylight, Moonlight, Israelite&quot;</strong><br />
This page features my grandfather's datebook. He's keeping accounts and also, apparently, jotting notes for a skit.</p>
