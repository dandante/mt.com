## Banjo Lessons

*What do you teach?*<br/>
Old-time clawhammer/frailing banjo. Lessons will often focus on source music
from the Southeastern U.S. Topics include tunes, songs, playing in jams. I
teach all levels: from beginners with no music experience to advanced players
who just want a little brush-up; from folks who want to play a song or two to
those consumed with old-time music fever.


*How much?*<br/>
<span class="emailaddress"></span> me for pricing.


*How long?*<br />
45 minutes to an hour, depending on how carried away we get,
or on what we decide is right for you.

*Philosophy/method*<br />
I love old time music, and want to share with my students how wonderful it is. I want to help people become independent learners; I show my students how
to figure out things on their own from listening and watching and, of course,
playing. I teach you to recognize patterns and put them together to make banjo music. Most of the music I play isn&rsquo;t written down anywhere, as
it comes from a folk tradition, so I don&rsquo;t use tablature or written
music, but teach people to learn by ear, although at the beginning levels
especially, I do write some things down. You go home with a recording of the
lesson, with the tunes talked through, played slowly and up to speed.You can
bring your own recording devices--iPhone, video camera, whatever--or we can
use my computer to record.

*Scheduling*<br />
Lessons are available on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Saturdays. We can schedule
a regular lesson or just one here and there. Most adult learners find that
every two weeks is a good interval, but many people like various intervals
between lessons. E-mail me and we can talk schedule details.

*Where?*<br />
On Tuesdays, lessons take place at my house in the Ravenna neighborhood of
Seattle, just north of the UW. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, lessons take
place at
[Dusty Strings](http://store.dustystrings.com/t-3-ms-PL-banjo.aspx?skinid=4").

*Missed and cancelled lessons*<br />
No charge if you cancel up to 24 hrs in advance. Full price for no-shows and
last-minute cancellations, unless you are sick, in which case you should stay
home, take care of yourself, and avoid spreading germs. However, do get in
touch with me as soon as you know you can't come. Dusty Strings has a
slightly different missed-lesson policy, so if you are taking lessons there,
be sure to familiarize yourself with it.

*Sounds exciting! I can't wait to start!*<br />
