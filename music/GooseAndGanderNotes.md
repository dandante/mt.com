    <div id="wrap">

        <ol>
    <li><em>Bowling Green</em>: From Cousin Emmy. You can find the original on a recording she made with the New Lost City Ramblers, <a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1846">Smithsonian/Folkways 31015</a>. Tuning: gEADE.</li>
    <li><em>Little Birdie</em>: This version is mainly influenced by <a href="http://www.nativeground.com/articles/96-the-coon-creek-girls-by-john-lilly.html">The Coon Creek Girls</a>--but also by the whole universe of Little Birdies. Tuning: aDAC#E.</li>
    <li><em>Old Kimball</em>: From Texas Gladden. You can hear the original on the Rounder CD <a href="http://www.rounder.com/artist/music/default.aspx?pid=62127&amp;aid=97692">Texas Gladden: Ballad Legacy</a>. I added the banjo. Tuning: dADAD.</li>
    <li><em>Rocky Hill</em>: I heard Stu Jamieson play this when he was at the Festival of American Fiddle Tunes some years ago. I wrote down the words and the tuning, but not Jamieson's source. I also did not record it, so this re-creation is probably inaccurate. Tuning: aEABE.</li>
    <li><em>Johnny Gordon</em>: From Dan Tate, who calls it &quot;Old Gray Goose.&quot; You can hear him play it on <a href="http://www.fieldrecorder.com/docs/store2006.htm">Field Recorders Collective #506</a>. He does the &quot;lost his cow&quot; verse, the &quot;sick today&quot; verse, and a not-for-mixed company (he says, giggling) verse about Mr. Gordon's wife. I made up the other verses, because the song needed more. And I don't play the banjo like Tate. Oh well. Tuning: aEADE.</li>
    <li><em>Scat Tom Kitty Puss</em>: Another from Cousin Emmy. Tuning: aEAC#E, capo 2.</li>
    <li><em>I Went Down to Raleigh</em>: From the Kimble Family. You can hear them play it on <a href="http://www.fieldrecorder.com/docs/store2006.htm#">Field Recorders Collective #106</a>. Tuning: fDGCD.</li>
    <li><em>Golden Willow Tree</em>: From Justus Begley. You can hear it on the Rounder album <a href="http://www.rounder.com/artist/music/default.aspx?pid=63694&amp;aid=96822">Anglo-American Ballads, Volume 2</a>. Mike Seeger also does a great version on his album, <a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=2970">True Vine</a>. Tuning: gCGCD.</li>
    <li><em>Old King Cole</em>: From Jean Ritchie. When I was growing up, we had a Folkways 10-inch record of Ritchie's, <a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1251">Children's Songs and Games from the Southern Mountains</a>, which had this song on it. Loved that record. Still do. Tuning: aEADE, capo 1.</li>
    <li><em>New River Train</em>: From the Monroe Brothers, with influences of Doc Watson and also <a href="http://www.rounder.com/artist/music/default.aspx?pid=61259&amp;aid=97307">Mike Seeger &amp; Paul Brown</a>. I was fooling around with this tuning and thought this song worked well in it. See if you can find the way too corny hammer-on. I couldn't resist. Tuning: aEG#BE.</li>
    <li><em>Old Bald Eagle</em>: A play-party song from Jean Ritchie, same source as &quot;Old King Cole,&quot; above. I don't do all the verses Ritchie does, and I added some verses that I adapted (Appalachian-ified and made more singable) from rhymes I found in Christina Rosetti's <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/rossetti/singsong/singsong.html">Sing-Song: A Nursery Rhyme Book</a>. If you can't make out the words to those verses, here they are: &quot;There is but one May in the year / May is dark and cold / There is but one May in the year / Before the year grows old.&quot; &quot;I have but one rose in this world / Now it droops so low / When my single rose is dead / Only thorns to show.&quot; &quot;Baby lies so fast asleep / That no pain can grieve her / Put a snowdrop in her hand / Kiss her once and leave her.&quot; Tuning: aDADE.</li>
    <li><em>Doney Where You Been So Long</em>. From Ola Belle Reed. You can hear it on the Rounder album <a href="http://www.rounder.com/artist/music/default.aspx?&amp;aid=97739&amp;in=2">Ola Belle Reed and Family</a>. Tuning: g#EG#BE (&quot;Reuben,&quot; or open D tuning, up one whole step to E). Oops, on the actual physical back cover of the CD, there's a typo in the tuning for this one. Sorry!</li>
    <li><em>London Bridge</em>. From Peggy Seeger. You can hear it on her album <a href="http://www.appleseedmusic.com/peggyseeger/lovecallmehome.html">Love Call Me Home</a>. Tuning: fCFAC (G tuning one whole step down).</li>
    <li><em>Family Song</em>: We thought this old nursery school favorite would be a nice one to end on. Tuning: aDADE.</li>

<p><strong>About the banjos</strong>:<br />
Cuts 3, 7, 8, 10, and 13 are played on a 1933 Tu-ba-phone with a reproduction neck made by Doug Ungar sometime in the 1970s. The other cuts are played on a 12&quot;-pot banjo made by Kevin Enoch in 1991.<strong><br />
