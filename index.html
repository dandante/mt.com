<p><strong>poetry and old-time music</strong></p>
<p><img width="65" height="106" src="/uploads/images/CupboardArtist_cover-final_33percent.jpg" class=" floatL" alt="" />In my poetry life, I write poems, give readings, teach writing classes and workshops, and encourage poetry everywhere. I have three books, <a href="/poems/books.html"><em>The Cupboard Artist</em></a> (Floating Bridge Press, 2012), <a href="poems/books.html"><em>Now</em></a> (Bear Star Press 2007), and <a href="poems/books.html"><em>By a Thread</em></a> (Van West &amp; Company, 2000), and my work appears in many journals and magazines.</p>

<img width="60" height="80" alt="" class="imgBorder floatL" src="uploads/images/tubaphone&#32;peghead.jpg" />In my music life, I play old-time banjo, fiddle and guitar. I give banjo lessons, play for dances, concerts, and in living rooms, and love to get together with friends who play. My recordings are <a href="music/index.html"><em>Instead of a Pony</em></a>, and <a href="music/index.html"><em>Goose and Gander</em></a>.</p>

    <li>Praise for <em>Goose and Gander</em> from <a href="http://www.bubbaguitar.com/newsletter.html" target="_blank">Bill Martin's weekly Portland newsletter</a>: &quot;Molly Tenenbaum's &quot;Goose<br />
    and Gander&quot; is another superb channeling. In particular, &quot;Old Kimball&quot; makes my socks roll up and down in a terrible frenzy.&quot; &quot;...fresh and alive, brilliantly played and innovative within the style. It takes a high degree of artistry and discipline to express yourself within a style of music and not mutilate it.&quot;</li>
