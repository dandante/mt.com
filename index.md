## poetry and old-time music

<img width="65" height="106" src="/uploads/images/CupboardArtist_cover-final_33percent.jpg" class=" floatL" alt="" />

In my poetry life, I write poems, give readings, teach writing classes and workshops, and encourage poetry everywhere. I have three books,
*[The Cupboard Artist](/poems/books.html)* (Floating Bridge Press, 2012),
*[Now](/poems/books/html)*(Bear Star Press 2007), and
*[By A Thread](/poems/books/html)* (Van West & Company, 2000),
and my work appears in many journals and magazines.

In my music life, I play old-time banjo, fiddle and guitar.
I give banjo lessons, play for dances, concerts, and in living rooms,
and love to get together with friends who play.
My recordings are
*[Instead of a Pony](/music/index.html)*, and
*[Goose and Gander](/music/index.html)*.

  Finally it's here, my new book! *Exercises to Free the Tongue*:
  poems and text by Molly Tenenbaum, artist's book by Ellen Ziegler,
  printing and binding by Paper Hammer. Illuminated with historic images
  and ephemera from Molly’s grandparents, ventriloquists on the vaudeville
  circuit in the early 1900s, this book of poems plays with ventriloquial
  metaphors of voice and breath. A long time in the works, this is a book to
  celebrate.

The artist's book is printed in a limited edition of 20 copies;
a less limited spiral-bound edition is also available, and you can even buy
it at the [store](/store/index.html).
5” x 13”, 42 pages. Click
[here](/poems/ExercisesExcerpts.html) to see more poems and pages from the book.

* Praise for *Goose and Gander* from
  [Bill Martin's weekly Portland newsletter](http://www.bubbaguitar.com/newsletter.html):
  "Molly Tenenbaum's "Goose
  and Gander" is another superb channeling. In particular,
  "Old Kimball" makes my socks roll up and down in a terrible frenzy."
  "...fresh and alive, brilliantly played and innovative within the style. It
  takes a high degree of artistry and discipline to express yourself within a
  style of music and not mutilate it."
