I am the author of three full-length poetry collections:
*The Cupboard Artist* (Floating Bridge Press, 2012)
*Now* (Bear Star Press 2007), and *By a Thread* (Van West & Company, 2000).
My chapbooks are *Blue Willow* (Floating Bridge Press, 1998),
*Old Voile* (New Michigan Press, 2004), and *Story* (Cash Machine, 2005). My
collaborative book with Ellen Ziegler, featuring photographs and poems about
ventriloquism, is just out, and is called *Exercises to Free the
Tongue*.

My poems have appeared in various journals, including *The Beloit Poetry
Journal*, *Best American Poetry 1991*, *Black Warrior Review*, *Crab Creek
Review*, *Crab Orchard Review*, *Cranky*, *The Diagram*, *Fine Madness*, *In
Posse*, *Nimrod*, *The Mississippi Review*, *New England Review*, *Poetry*,
*Poetry Daily*, *Poetry Northwest*, *Prairie Schooner*, *River Styx*,
*Shenandoah*, and *Swivel*.

Honors include residencies at Hedgebrook and at the Helen Riaboff Whiteley
Center, participation in the Jack Straw Writers' Program, and a 2009
Washington State Artist Trust Fellowship.

I am also a musician, playing old-time banjo music from the southeastern
United States; my two solo CDs are* Instead of a Pony* and *Goose and
Gander*. I play for dances, weddings, and parties, in concerts and in cafes.
My bands are The Queen CIty Bulldogs and Dram County, and I do duets with my
brother, Dan Tenenbaum. Banjo lessons available.

I live in Seattle,
[teaching banjo](/music/banjo-lessons.html) in the living room
and English at
[North Seattle Community College](https://northseattle.edu/).
